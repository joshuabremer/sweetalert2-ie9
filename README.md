SweetAlert2 for IE9+
-----------

An unofficial fork of SweetAlert2 from https://github.com/limonte/sweetalert2.

The SweetAlert2 library is an excellent popup library, but requires a few small changes to work for IE9. This provides support for all modern browsers and IE9+. 

All credit to limonte for creating the library.
